It initially worked fine.
But later was declared slow

## Java StackOverflow error

I got this while tried to implement the recursive approach.  

## Time Limit Exceed error.

## Solution

I just changed the statement
while(l<=mid)  
to  
while(l<= r)  

And it worked.
I don't know why but will check in debug.
